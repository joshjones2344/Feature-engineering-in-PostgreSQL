--Task 01 Perform One-Hot Encoding on the variable on one or more Categorical Variables in the
--dataset
--i want to perform 1 variable only on this task lotshape namely

CREATE TABLE LotShape_encoded AS
SELECT *,
       CASE WHEN LotShape = 'Regular' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS RegularLotshape_encoded,
       CASE WHEN LotShape = 'Slightly irregular' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS SlightlyIrregular_encoded,
       CASE WHEN LotShape = 'Moderately Irregular' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS ModeratelyIrregular_encoded,
	   CASE WHEN LotShape = 'Irregular' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS Irregular_encoded
FROM property_sales;

-- you can drop some unneccessary column so that we can determine and represent the generated binary on the target variable
--sample we remove lotshape Column

ALTER TABLE lotshape_encoded
DROP COLUMN LotShape;

--if you like to run the query on that specific table use to check the binary on that target variable 
--you find at the last column cause i dont use GROUP(BY) clause:

SELECT * FROM lotshape_encoded
