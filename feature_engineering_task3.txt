--Perform Mean encoding on one or more Categorical Variables in the dataset (hint: you may want to use OVER() and PARTITION() commands)
-- as shown to our csv file we easily distinguist that bldgtype column and saleprice column give monotonic relatioship as categories and target 
--so we used it on this  for task3 
--since we dont go to categorize all column then we can use PARTITION BY clause
--use this script

SELECT
    id,
    bldgtype,
    saleprice,
    AVG(saleprice) OVER (PARTITION BY bldgtype) AS mean_saleprice
FROM
    property_sales;

--note that we can use other category variable to its accepted relation to other  numeric variables
